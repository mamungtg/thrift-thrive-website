<!-- Who We Are -->
<section>
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
        Thrift & Thrive Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded by a mother of two neurodiverse children—built from lived experience and a deep understanding of the daily challenges families face.
    </p>
    <p>
        We support families raising children with autism and other neurodivergent needs by providing practical assistance, inclusive resources, and meaningful community connections.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our work is rooted in compassion, dignity, and real-life solutions.

<!-- Meaning Section -->
<section>
    <h2>What “Thrift & Thrive” Means</h2>

    <h3>Thrift</h3>
    <p>
        Thrift means using resources wisely, intentionally, and compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
        We help ensure families have access to clothing, essentials, and sensory-friendly items without waste, shame, or financial strain. It is about caring for one another and making the most of what we have—together.
    </p>

    <h3>Thrive</h3>
    <p>
        To thrive is to grow, flourish, and succeed—especially when supported.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thriving happens when children and families have what they need: stability, understanding, and community. It is not just about surviving challenges. It is about rising beyond them.
    </p>
